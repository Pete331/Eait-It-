# Eat-It!
Eat-It! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app display's the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The app store's every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
